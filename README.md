# sunnyside-landing-page 
This project is done as a solution to a challenge from frontendmentor.io. I build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I developed it using mostly HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle.

users are able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
